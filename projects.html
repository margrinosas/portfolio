            <h3>Clear Wave Company</h3>
            <p>
              Clear Wave is an initiative that encourages people to participate
              in collecting ocean or coastal trash by offering financial
              incentives as a reward for their efforts. Depending on the amount
              and type of waste removed, people get cash in return. At the end
              of the day, the waste is collected and sold to recycling
              companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this website we wanted to convey the company's message in a
              way that would have more impact on society. Therefore, statistical
              data, evidence of environmental impact, and photographs and videos
              were included to increase public awareness.

            <h3>ShopSmart Company</h3>
            <p>
              Shop Smart simplifies grocery shopping in Barcelona by helping
              people find the best prices for their items across multiple
              supermarkets, plan their nutrition, and navigate stores
              efficiently with ShopSmart supermarket maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project I worked on both the development and creation of
              the website and the application for different devices including
              mobile phones, tablets or iPads and computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website emphasizes the people's problem and proposes a clear
              and concise solution. The company's services are displayed in a
              user-friendly way so that it is easy to navigate, understand and
              buy.

            <h3>The immersive world of Avatar</h3>
            <p>
              Theat.er is a theater company from Madrid which performs plays
              based on films, books or musicals in different places in Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this specific case, they contacted me to design the website for
              online ticket sales for their Avatar play. On this website there
              was information about the group, the sale of tickets and the sale
              of company merchandising.
